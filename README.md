## What is Computational Physics?
[Computational physics] is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science. 

It is the study of scientific problems using computational methods; it combines computer science, physics and applied mathematics to develop scientific solutions to complex problems. Computational physics complements the areas of theory and experimentation in traditional scientific investigation.

## Why is it needed?
In physics, different theories based on mathematical models provide very precise predictions on how systems behave. Unfortunately, it is often the case that solving the mathematical model for a particular system in order to produce a useful prediction is not feasible. This can occur when the solution is too complicated. In such cases, numerical approximations are required.

Computational physics is the subject that deals with these numerical approximations: the approximation of the solution is written as a finite (and typically large) number of simple mathematical operations (algorithm), and a computer is used to perform these operations and compute an approximated solution and respective error.
